        <h1>Childhood Lead Exposure by Census Tracts in Minnesota</h1>

        <p class="main">Preventing early-life exposure to lead is important for life-long health. Elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) in young children are linked with adverse health effects, including learning problems, behavioral problems, and even death if exposures are very high. Children less than 6 years of age living in homes built before 1978 are most at risk for lead exposure. Younger children are at greater risk because their bodies absorb lead more easily and their brains are still developing.</p>
